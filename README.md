## PRET - Printer Exploitation Toolkit

**Is your printer secure? Check before someone else does...**

PRET is a new tool for printer security testing developed in the scope of a [Master's Thesis](http://nds.rub.de/media/ei/arbeiten/2017/01/13/exploiting-printers.pdf) at Ruhr University Bochum. It connects to a device via network or USB and exploits the features of a given printer language. Currently [PostScript](https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf), [PJL](http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/bpl13208.pdf) and [PCL](http://www.hp.com/ctg/Manual/bpl13210.pdf) are supported which are spoken by most laser printers. This allows cool stuff like capturing or manipulating print jobs, accessing the printer's file system and memory or even causing physical damage to the device. All attacks are documented in detail in the [Hacking Printers Wiki](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/).

The main idea of PRET is to facilitate the communication between the end-user and the printer. Thus, after entering a UNIX-like command, PRET translates it to PostScript, PJL or PCL, sends it to the printer, evaluates the result and translates it back to a user-friendly format. PRET offers a whole bunch of commands useful for printer attacks and fuzzing.

### Installation

PRET only requires a Python3 interpreter. For colored output and SNMP support however, third party modules need to be installed:

    # python3 -m pip install colorama pysnmp

If running on a Windows console and Unicode characters are not displayed correctly, install the *win_unicode_console* module:

    # python3 -m pip install win_unicode_console

For experimental, ‘driverless’ printing (see print command), ImageMagick and GhostScript need to be installed:

    # apt-get install imagemagick ghostscript

### Usage

```
usage: pret.py [-h] [-s] [-q] [-d] [-i file] [-o file] target {ps,pjl,pcl}

positional arguments:
  target                printer device or hostname
  {ps,pjl,pcl}          printing language to abuse

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --safe            verify if language is supported
  -q, --quiet           suppress warnings and chit-chat
  -d, --debug           enter debug mode (show traffic)
  -i file, --load file  load and run commands from file
  -o file, --log file   log raw data sent to the target
```

###### Example usage:

    $ ./pret.py laserjet.lan ps
    $ ./pret.py /dev/usb/lp0 pjl

###### Positional Arguments:

PRET requires a valid target and a printer language as arguments. The target can either be the IP address/hostname of a network printer (with port 9100/tcp open) or a device like `/dev/usb/lp0` for a local USB printer. To quickly discover all network printers in your subnet using SNMP broadcast, simply run PRET without arguments:

```
./pret.py
No target given, discovering local printers

address          device                       uptime    status                 
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
192.168.1.5      hp LaserJet 4250             10:21:49   Ready                 
192.168.1.11     HP LaserJet M3027 MFP        13 days    Paper jam             
192.168.1.27     Lexmark X792                 153 days   Ready                 
192.168.1.28     Brother MFC-7860DW           16:31:17   Sleep mode            
```

The printer language to be abused must be one of `ps`, `pjl` or `pcl`. Not all languages are supported by every printer, so you may want to switch languages if you don't receive any feedback. Each printer language is mapped to a different set of PRET commands and has different capabilities to exploit.

###### Optional Arguments:

`--safe` tries to check via IPP, HTTP and SNMP if the selected printing language (PS/PJL/PCL) is actually supported by the device before connecting. On non-networked printers (USB, parallel cable) this test will fail.

`--quit` suppresses printer model determination, intro message and some other chit-chat.

`--debug` shows the datastream actually sent to the device and the feedback received. Note that header data and other overhead is filtered. The see the whole traffic, use wireshark. Debugging can also be switched on/off within a PRET session using the `debug` command 

`--load filename` reads and executes PRET commands from a text file. This is useful for automation. Command files can also be invoked later within a PRET session via the `load` command.

`--log filename` writes a copy of the raw datastream sent to the printer into a file. This can be useful to build a malicious print job file which can be deployed on another printer not directly reachable, for example by printing it from USB drive.

### Generic Commands

After connecting to a printer device, you will see the PRET shell and can execute various commands:

```
$ ./pret.py laserjet.lan pjl

Not all commands are supported by every printer. Especially Brother and Kyocera devices use their own PostScript clones – Br-Script and KPDL – instead of licensing original ‘Adobe PostScript’. Such flavours of the PostScript language may not be 100% compatible, especially concerning security sensitive features like capturing print jobs. Access to the file system is supported by most printers, however usually limited to a certain, sandboxed directory.

  info status      - Provides the current printer status.
  info ustatus     - Lists the unsolicited status variables.

```

Some commands are supported exclusively by HP printers, because other vendors have only implemented a subset of the PJL standard. This is especially true for PML based commands like `restart`or `reset`. Enabling long-term job retention via the `hold` command seems to be possible for some Epson devices only. NVRAM access via the `nvram` command is a proprietary feature of Brother printers. Limited access to the file system is supported by various HP, OKI, Konica, Xerox, Epson and Ricoh devices.

### Commands in PCL mode

```
selftest   Perform printer self-test.
info       Show information:  info <category>
  info fonts      - Show installed fonts.
  info macros     - Show installed macros.
  info patterns   - Show user-defined patterns.
  info symbols    - Show symbol sets.
  info extended   - Show extended fonts.
```

PCL is a very limited page description language without access to the file system. The `get`/`put`/`ls` commands therefore use a virtual file system based on PCL macros, implemented mostly for the hack value. This proof-of-concept shows that even a device which supports only minimalist languages like PCL can be used to store arbitrary files like copyright infringing material. Although such a file sharing service is not a security vulnerability per se, it might apply as ‘misuse of service’ depending on the corporate policy

### Getting Started

Given the features and various proprietary extensions in printing languages like PostScript and PJL, conducting a pentest on printers is not a trivial job. PRET can help to assist and verify known issues in the language. Once you have played around with the tool, you may want to perform a systematic printer security analysis. A good starting point is the [Printer Security Testing Cheat Sheet](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php?title=Printer_Security_Testing_Cheat_Sheet).

**Happy Hacking!**
